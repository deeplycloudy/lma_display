<h3><a name = "station">station:</a></h3> The LMA station identifier<br>
<p>

<h3><a name = "name">name:</a></h3> The LMA station name<br>
<p>

<h3><a name = "status">status:</a></h3> "up" indicates the LMA station is working.  "down"
indicates the LMA station has not reported its status recently, so is probably offline or
off.  The "sdate" and "stime" fields show the last time the station reported its status.
"offline" indicates the system has no information on the last time the station reported its
status.

<h3><a name = "sdate">sdate:</a></h3> The Linux system date, from the BIOS
clock.  

<h3><a name = "stime">stime:</a></h3> The Linux system time, from the BIOS
clock.

<h3><a name = "load">load:</a></h3> The system load.  x/y/z minute
load average.  x = 1 minute average, y = 5 minute average, z = 15
minute average.  Unless doing something major, these numbers should
all be much less than unity.  (The one minute one might vary a bit,
but for sure, you should generally see the 15 minute average be very
close to zero, or else there may be a process consuming too much of the 
CPU.)

<h3><a name = "uptime">uptime:</a></h3> The amount of time since the
last reboot.

<h3><a name = "duty">duty:</a></h3> The percentage of time the station
was taking data in the last 30 days

<h3><a name = "slash">/:</a></h3> The percent of full capacity for the /
partition.  (/ is where the core OS is located.)  Should always be in the
neighborhood of 80-90%.  LMA data gets stored on separate partitions (see
below).

<h3><a name = "boot">/boot</a></h3> The percent of full capacity for 
the /boot partition if there is one.

<h3><a name = "shm">/dev/shm</a></h3> The percent of full capacity for
the /dev/shm filesystem.

<h3><a name = "data">/data:</a></h3> The percent of full capacity for
the /data partition.  This is the primary data partition for the
USB solid-state hard-disk.  

<h3><a name = "pid">PID:</a></h3> This is the process ID for the
lma_DataHandler program (the program which actually collects data from
the LMA board, and writes it to shared memory).  If there's a number there,
then it is running.  If there isn't a number, there is a problem.  Note, no
checking is done to ensure that only one process is running, so this isn't a
perfect test, but if there's a number there, and the rest of the other things
below are okay, we are golden.  

<h3><a name = "pidrd">PIDRD:</a></h3> This is the process ID of the 
lma_ReadData program, the daemon which reads LMA data out of shared memory and
writes it to a data file.

<h3><a name = "pidtl">PIDTL:</a></h3> This is the process ID of the 
lma_TrigLog program, the daemon which reads LMA status out of shared memory
and writes it to a trigger file.

<h3><a name = "pidat">PIDAT:</a></h3> This is the process ID of the 
lma_AutoThresh program, the daemon which adjusts the threshold.

<h3><a name = "piddec">PIDDEC:</a></h3> This is the process ID of the 
lma_Decimate program, the daemon which reads LMA data out of shared memory,
decimates it, and sends it to the real-time processing computer.

<h3><a name = "pphase">Phase:</a></h3> The phase count of the oscillator --
the difference between 25,000,000 and the actual number of cycles for the
local data clock.

<h3><a name = "pdate">pdate:</a></h3> This is the date, as reported by
LMA board.

<h3><a name = "ptime">ptime:</a></h3> This is the time, as reported by
the LMA board.

<h3><a name = "temp">temp:</a></h3> This is the temperature (Celsius)
of the LMA board.

<!--
<h3><a name = "rh">RH:</a></h3> This is the relative humidity (raw
uncalibrated scale) at the LMA board.
-->

<h3><a name = "gps">gps:</a></h3> The number of satellites being
tracked by the GPS receiver, as reported by the LMA board.

<h3><a name = "ctrig">current trigfile:</a></h3> The name of the
current trigger log file, for a recent second.  
(Trigger logs are found in the directory /home/lma/log/.)

<h3><a name = "trigid">trig ID:</a></h3> The station letter, as
reported in the trigger log, for a recent second.

<h3><a name = "tdate">tdate:</a></h3> The date, as reported in the
trigger log file, for a recent second.

<h3><a name = "ttime">ttime:</a></h3> The time, are reported in the
trigger log file, for a recent second.

<h3><a name = "tver">tver:</a></h3> The firmware version for the LMA
board, as reported in the trigger log file, for a recent second.

<h3><a name = "tthresh">tthresh:</a></h3> The threshold (in dBm) of
the station, as reported in the trigger log file, for a recent second.  

<h3><a name = "ttrigs">ttrigs/s:</a></h3> The current trigger rate as
reported by the trigger log file, for a recent second.

<h3><a name = "tsat">tsat:</a></h3> The number of satellites being
tracked by the GPS receiver, as reported in the trigger log file, for
a recent second.

<h3><a name = "ttemp">ttemp:</a></h3> The temperature (Celsius) as
reported in the trigger log file, for a recent second.

<h3><a name = "fl0">files today</a></h3> This is the count of
number of data files collected for the current day.  There should be 6
ten-minute files per hour.

<h3><a name = "fl1">files today-1</a></h3> This is the count of
number of data files collected for yesterday.  If all is well, this should be
144 (6 files per hour times 24 hours).

<h3><a name = "fl2">files today-2</a></h3> This is the count of
number of data files collected for two days ago.  If all is well, this should
be 144 (6 files per hour times 24 hours).

<h3><a name = "datafile">current datafile:</a></h3> The data file
which the lma_DataHandler program is current writing to (assuming it
is currently active, otherwise it would be the one last written to).  The data
files are in the directory /home/lma/data/YYMMDD.

<h3><a name = "vp1">vp1</a></h3> Voltage of solar panel 1
<h3><a name = "vp2">vp2</a></h3> Voltage of solar panel 2
<h3><a name = "cp1">cp1</a></h3> Current of solar panel 1
<h3><a name = "cp2">cp2</a></h3> Current of solar panel 2
<h3><a name = "vb1">vb1</a></h3> Voltage of battery 1
<h3><a name = "vb2">vb2</a></h3> Voltage of battery 2
<h3><a name = "cb1">cb1</a></h3> Current of battery 1
<h3><a name = "cb2">cb2</a></h3>Current of battery 2
<h3><a name = "vl">vl</a></h3> Voltage to load
<h3><a name = "cl">cl</a></h3> Current to load

<h3><a name = "rtt">decimation status</a></h3> This indicates whether the
decimation process has stopped working.  (The decimation can stop working when
the Internet dies -- the decimation program tries to send data to a
no-longer-active Internet, which hangs the program.) If so, log onto the
station and give the command "/root/bin/lma_restart.pl".  There is a cron
process which checks to make sure the decimation program is active, so this
should be done automatically.
